                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>In psychology, or mindfulness, there is a practice of handling lot of thoughts; write it down on a piece of paper and decide a time when to go through the thoughts.</p>
                    <p>As my note-cube had in mysterious way disappeared, I couldn't apply it in my daily work, and I needed it for work, since a lot of thoughts where popping up at freetime. A normal person would most probably go to a shop and by a new note-cube, but I found out, why not make an app for it instead - more fun :D</p>
                    <p>Since ideas related to work may be intellectual property, it was utmost important to keep the thoughts safe. I also didn't want to have any online-storage which will cost a small fee, so I ended up to rely on emails</p><p>It is intented to use the work account was used to save your thoughts, since then everything is kept in the organization. To use your work-account together with Think-Later, your organization needs to approve it. Therefore, Think-Later will be released as open source project, to simplify that process.</p>
                    <p>You may add more addresses as possible receivers. This is a way to send ideas to your work-account without the organization doesn't need to approve Think-Later app. <span style="color:red">If you organization don't let you use it, don't do it and follow their guidelines.</span></p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Enjoy the app!</p>
